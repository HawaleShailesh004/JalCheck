## 📌 Problem Statement  
India is on the verge of a **severe water crisis**:  
- ⚠️ 70% of India’s water is contaminated  
- ⚠️ By 2030, demand will **double supply** (NITI Aayog)  
- ⚠️ Citizens are unaware of their **hidden water footprint** (e.g., 1 cotton shirt = 2,700L water)  

Existing tools are either **too generic**, **not India-specific**, or **lack actionable alternatives**.

✔️ Search or scan products → see hidden water cost  
✔️ Get eco-friendly alternatives instantly
